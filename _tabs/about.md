Welcome to my blog - nice to meet you :)

I am a security and forensics enthusiast in constant study mode. I will try to publish everything related to cyber security, digital forensics, cyber investigation, malware analysis, various operating system analysis, etc.

I am also studying Digital Forensics and Cyber Investigations at a university in my country. 
I will do my best to share with all of you the knowledge I will acquire in school and at work.
