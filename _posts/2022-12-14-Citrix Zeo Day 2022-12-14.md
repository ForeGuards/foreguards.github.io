# Hackers exploit critical Citrix ADC and Gateway zero day, patch now - No workarounds are available for this vulnerability yet.

## Overview

* 'Critical' zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2022-27518) in Citrix ADC and Gateway
* This new vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands remotely on vulnerable devices and take control over them.
* The vulnerability impacts the following versions of Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway:
	-   Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-58.32
	-   Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 12.1 before 12.1-65.25
	-   Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.291
	-   Citrix ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.291
- The above versions are impacted only if the appliances are configured as a <font color="red">SAML SP</font> (_SAML service provider)_ or <font color="red">SAML IdP</font> (_SAML identity provider)_.
- Administrators can determine how the device is configured by inspecting the <font color="red">"ns.conf"</font> file for the following two commands:
	- `add authentication samlAction`
	- `add authentication samlIdPProfile`
- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway version `13.1` are not affected by <font color="yellow">CVE-2022-27518</font> , so upgrading to it solves the security problem.
- Also, Citrix ADC FIPS and Citrix ADC NDcPP should upgrade to versions 12.1-55.291 or later.

* Customers who are running affected builds can set up audit logging to monitor for unauthorized activity on ADC or Gateway devices. Learn more at [https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/system/audit-logging/configuring-audit-logging.html](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/system/audit-logging/configuring-audit-logging.html).
* <font color="red">Likewise</font> Citrix ADC configurations that do not use SAML authentication (e.g., traditional load balancing configurations) and related products such as Citrix Application Delivery Management (ADM) and Citrix SD-WAN are not affected.

## Exploited by state-sponsored hackers

While Citrix has not shared any details on how this new bug is being abused, the NSA has shared that the state-sponsored APT5 hackers (aka UNC2630 and MANGANESE) are actively exploiting the vulnerability in attacks.

In a coordinated disclosure, the NSA has released an "[APT5: Citrix ADC Threat Hunting Guidance](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Dec/13/2003131586/-1/-1/0/CSA-APT5-CITRIXADC-V1.PDF)" advisory with information on detecting if a device has been exploited and tips on securing Citrix ADC and Gateway devices.

![A screenshot](/assets/pictures/1.png)

```shell
cd /netscaler ; for i in “nsppe nsaaad nsconf nsreadfile nsconmsg”; do md5 ${i} ; done
```

Additionally, the following command can indicate tampering by one APT5 technique. This is indicated by one line of output, but no output otherwise:

```shell
procstat –v $(pgrep –o –i nsppe) | grep “0x10400000 “ | grep “rwx”
```

## Behavioral Checks

NSA recommends that organizations leverage off-device  logging mechanisms for all system logs, to include `dmesg` and `ns.log`, and actively  
monitor them for the following activity:

-   Instances of pb_policy appearing in logs without being linked to expected administrator activity.
	- The actors have been seen leveraging tools that run 'pb_policy' twice. This creates the following logs in ns.log:
    
		    <local0.info> [hostname] pb_policy: Changing pitboss policy from X to Y 
		    <local0.info> [hostname] pb_policy: Changing pitboss policy from Y to X
    
    Where X and Y are constant values for your system.
-   Gaps in logs, or mismatches between logs on the device and in your remote logging solution.
-  Legitimate user account activity without a corresponding record of a valid SAML token being issued by the identity provider for the environment.
-  Unauthorized modification of user permissions.
-  Unauthorized modifications to the crontab file and/or existence of suspicious file(s) in /var/cron/tabs/ and other locations.
    -   Files related to this activity have been discovered in /tmp for some, but not all, impacted organizations. 
    -  The command below can assist in finding files that have been associated with this activity. While these files have not been discovered in all environments, their presence may be indicative of actor activity if discovered.


```shell
find / -type f -name “res*” | grep -E ‘res($|\.[a-z]{3})$’
```

## Customer FAQ:

> **Can we fix this vulnerability using Web Application Firewall signatures?**
   No, it is not possible to fix the vulnerability with Web Application Firewall signatures.

> **Is there a workaround or mitigation that I could use instead of updating?**
   Citrix recommends applying the builds released December 13, 2022. No workarounds are available beyond disabling SAML authentication or upgrading to a current build.
